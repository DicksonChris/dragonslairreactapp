## Implementation
We began with two existing websites, the website the business was using (found [here](https://dragonslairjerky.com/)), and a Bootstrapped website Mr. Man  built in another Nucamp course (viewable [here](https://dragonslair.netlify.app) and `[code]`[here](https://github.com/sfotxl/dragonslair).) 

We used [**OpenStreetMap**](https://www.openstreetmap.org) for our Map components.

We used [**React Router v6**](https://reactrouter.com/) for navigation.

And we used [**Yup**](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form validation.
